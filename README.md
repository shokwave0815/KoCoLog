# KoCoLog
Viewer for exported Logfiles of KoCoBox.

Reading the logs in the webfrontend of the KoCoBox is IMHO a pain. Exporting and reading the plain text file isn't really better.
So I wrote this little tool which has some nice features like a filter and highlighting warnings, error and fatal errors.

It's written in FreePascal with the Lazarus-IDE without additional components.

It is just a fun project so I won't support it at all.
